# AWS Data Exchange

**AWS Data Exchange** is a service that makes it easy to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. Data providers can list and monetize their data, while data subscribers can easily discover and access valuable datasets.

## Key Features
- **Data Marketplace**: Browse and subscribe to thousands of datasets from over 300 qualified data providers.
- **Automated Delivery**: Automatically receive new data revisions and updates as providers publish them.
- **Native AWS Integration**: Use data directly with AWS analytics services like Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and AWS Data Pipeline.
- **Secure Access**: Data is transferred securely within AWS, and access is managed via AWS IAM.
- **Licensing & Entitlements**: Providers can set flexible licensing terms; subscribers pay only for what they subscribe to.

## Common Use Cases
- **Financial Services**: Access market data, economic indicators, and alternative data for trading and risk analysis.
- **Healthcare & Life Sciences**: Subscribe to clinical trial data, genomics data, or public health datasets.
- **Marketing & Advertising**: Obtain consumer behavior, demographics, and location data for targeted campaigns.
- **Machine Learning**: Acquire high-quality labeled datasets to train and improve ML models.

## How It Works
1. **Find Data**: Browse the AWS Data Exchange catalog on the AWS Marketplace.
2. **Subscribe**: Review terms and subscribe to a data product.
3. **Access Data**: Data is delivered directly to your Amazon S3 bucket.
4. **Use Data**: Analyze data using your preferred AWS services.

## Pricing

## Exam Tips
