# AWS Outposts

**AWS Outposts** extends AWS infrastructure, services, and APIs to on-premises data centers or co-location facilities.

### Key Exam Points
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Run AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, EBS) *locally* on AWS-provided hardware.
- **Low Latency**: Ideal for apps requiring single-digit millisecond latency to on-premises systems.
- **Data Residency**: Used when data must remain in a specific geographic location for compliance.
- **Networking**: Connects to the AWS Region via Direct Connect or VPN; uses **Local Gateway (LGW)** to route traffic to your on-premises network.
- **Management**: Fully managed by AWS (monitoring, patching, and hardware replacement).
