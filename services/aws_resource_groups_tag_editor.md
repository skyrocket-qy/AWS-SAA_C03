# AWS Resource Groups & Tag Editor

**AWS Resource Groups** and **Tag Editor** help organize and manage AWS resources at scale.

### Key Exam Points
- **Resource Groups**: Allow you to "group" resources based on tags or CloudFormation stacks.
    - **Automation**: Perform bulk actions on group members via **Systems Manager** (e.g., patching all "Production" instances).
- **Tag Editor**: A global tool to "find" resources (especially cross-region) and "bulk tag" them.
- **Scenario**: Use Resource Groups to create application-centric views and automate management tasks across multiple regions.
