# AWS Snow Family

The **AWS Snow Family** provides physical devices for massive data migration and edge computing in disconnected environments.

### Key Exam Points
- **Snowcone**: Smallest (8-14 TB); portable/rugged; includes **DataSync** for online transfer.
- **Snowball Edge**: Briefcase-sized (80-210 TB); rugged.
    - **Storage Optimized**: For large data migrations.
    - **Compute Optimized**: High CPU/GPU for local processing (ML, Video).
- **Snowmobile**: Semi-trailer (up to 100 PB); for exabyte-scale migrations.
- **Use Case**: Data migration where internet bandwidth is the bottleneck or edge computing in remote areas (ships, mines).
- **Security**: Data is encrypted; TPM (Trusted Platform Module) ensures tamper-resistance.
