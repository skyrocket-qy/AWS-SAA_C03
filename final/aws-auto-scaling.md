# AWS Auto Scaling

### Function
Service that monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

### Use Case
- Managing groups of resources (ASG, ECS, DynamoDB, Spot Fleets) collectively.
- Using a single scaling plan for a multi-resource application suite.

### Tips
- Different from EC2 Auto Scaling (which is specific to instances).
- Provides a unified interface for scaling multiple resources.
