# Amazon VPC

### Function
Service that lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

### Use Case
- Isolating application tiers for security.
- Defining custom IP address ranges and subnets.

### Tips
- Subnets (Public/Private).
- Route Tables, Internet Gateway (IGW), NAT Gateway (Public to Private traffic).
- Security Groups (Stateful) vs. NACLs (Stateless).
- VPC Flow Logs.
