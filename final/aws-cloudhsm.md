# AWS CloudHSM

### Function
Cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud.

### Use Case
- Workloads requiring FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance.
- Scenarios where the customer must have exclusive control of HSM instances.

### Tips
- Single-tenant hardware.
- User-managed; high operational overhead compared to KMS.
